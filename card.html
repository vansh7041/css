        <h1>Lion</h1>
        <br>
        <p>A lion is a large, powerful carnivorous animal known for its majestic mane (in males) and its status as a symbol of strength and bravery. Often called the "king of the jungle," lions live in social groups called prides, where they cooperate in hunting and protecting their territory. They have a golden-brown coat and are found primarily in sub-Saharan Africa.
